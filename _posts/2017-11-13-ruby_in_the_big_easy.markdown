This week I will be ðŸ›« flying down to New Orleans, the Big Easy, for my first [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/). I am fortunate to have been selected as a RubyConf *Scholar* this year, meaning that the conference has graciously chosen to cover the cost of my attendance and connected me with a *Guide*, a more seasoned participant who can help shape my experience (I even got two guides: *ðŸ‘‹ Hi Stella & Caleb!*). I would not have been able to attend RubyConf without this generosity, and even if I would have been able to, my experience would certainly not be as rich and meaningful without the additional support and programming, so I am immensely grateful.  

This will be my first technical conference in almost 15 years. Back in 1999 I co-founded an information security conference in San Diego called [Toorcon](https://toorcon.net/), which is still going strong, but a few years later my life took a different direction and I've only recently returned to coding. If you're interested more in my background you can read my blog post on [Why Would A Rabbi Learn To Code?](http://thecodingrabbi.com/2017/05/02/why_would_a_rabbi_learn_to_code/) on my blog.

As I get ready to leave for RubyConf tomorrow, I thought it important to share some of my goals for this conference to both hold myself accountable and to share with others who might also find themselves in a similar situation. My fellow Flatiron School alum and friend, Yechiel Kalmenson, [shared his reflections](https://dev.to/yechielk/of-conferences-and-scholars-6mn) just a few days ago as well and they are excellent. At this conference I hope to:

* Make at least 2 meaningful new connections each day â˜‘
* Attend 1 session a day that will be out of my current depth and expand my knowledge â˜‘
* Attend 3-4 sessions a day that will deepen my existing knowledge â˜‘
* Not be afraid to skip a session to make a new friend â˜‘
* Blog about my new learning at least 1 time â˜‘

I will be sharing my reflections here after the conference so check back then to hear how it went!
